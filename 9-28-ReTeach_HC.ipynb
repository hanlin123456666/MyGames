    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "You're the co-founder of an education startup, and are responsible for demonstrating a proof of concept for a new automated teacher feedback product called ReTeach. ReTeach is an automatic platform that listens to teachers in the classroom, and acts as an Observer to provide feedback to teachers. This process is usually done by a human observer, but the observer is rarely able to focus on deep dives into teaching strategy since they need to manually record many components of the data. Your product frees them from this responsibility so that their time can be spent critically assessing higher levels of teaching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team has already collected some data is now entering the first phase of analysis, to:\n",
    "* Ensure the data content is what is expected\n",
    "* Determine what types of insights can be gathered from the data prior to modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "Your data is as follows. You have:\n",
    "* 3 teachers participating in the study. The teachers are anonymized by an ID.\n",
    "* Each teacher is observed 3 times. Each observation results in a separate table (csv file).\n",
    "* Each csv file has the same structure.\n",
    "* Each csv file has 3 \"columns\": the timestamp of the beginning of the statement, the statement, and the label given by the observer about the statement.\n",

    "## Assignment Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Part 1**. In this portion of the assignment, you'll modify the data so that the analysis can be carried out. The first half of this assignment provides specific instructions regarding how the steps of the analysis should be carried out. Make sure to follow these instructions.\n",
    "* **Part 2**: The second half of this assignment will leverage this modified dataframe and requires you to discern what is being asked and use Python/pandas code in order to determine te solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage of Generative AI and Collaboration\n",
    "You **cannot** copy/paste questions/data for this assignment into any generative AI to create solutions for you, **except** in the case of regular expressions. Just let it help you with regular expressions; do not expend any time trying to do these on your own (unless you just want to). \n",
    "\n",
    "You should attempt all of these questions on your own first, using the information we learned in class as well as the Pandas API. You can use the generative AI to _help_ you, meaning that you can give it your answer, explain your logic, and then ask it to explain any logical fallacies to you. It should not give you any direct answers. You can also work with other people, but you should not tell each other the answer or copy/paste answers from each other. You can discuss approaches, but you should not provide code or very specific answers to be submitted."

    "[commentary] The graphs provide quick insights, helping me understand the patterns and differences rapidly. The code makes it convenient for us to perform a wide range of analyses and document the analysis process. 522 has the most invalid data, followed by 231 and 009. Among all the teachers, for the non-missing data, OTR is the most frequent, followed by PRS and REP. 009 has two labels, while 231 and 522 each have three labels. For both 009 and 231, the frequencies for each label are similar. However, for 522, the label OTR is the most frequent, followed by PRS and REP. Only 522 matches the overall distribution pattern."

    "Answer using code **and visualizations** as appropriate. For plots, make sure that axes are labeled and titles are used. A visual inspection of the differences is sufficient. Make sure you comment on your answer to explain your thoughts, and also discuss other interpretations of any differences in the distribution of labels across observers."

    "[commentary]Overall, the maximum length of a teacher's statement is 25, while the minimum is 4. The average length is 11, with a median also at 11. The interquartile range, representing the middle 50% of the data, spans from 9 to 13. Comparing individual teachers, 522 is the only one whose average (12.7) and median (13) exceed the overall average and median. Both 009 and 231 share the same median of 10. Among them, 522 possesses the largest maximum statement length, followed by 009 and then 231. Conversely, 231 has the smallest minimum statement length. The range for 522 is from 5 to 25, making it the broadest among the teachers. Additionally, 522 has a slightly longer interquartile range compared to 009 and 231. "
